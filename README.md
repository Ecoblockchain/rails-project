The idea of this app is as follows: users create so-called 'seals'. Only authorized users are able to view these seals. Users could then create QR-codes, for example, out of the URLs to these seals, and print them on physical products (wine bottles, expensive cheese) so the authenticity of these products could be verified by the retailer, and later on, the consumers.

I have a feeling that this could be a great app some day. Unfortunately, that day is not today. The app is hopelessly unfinished. It has account creation, login, seal creation and seal viewing by authorized users implemented. So much of what I had planned is unimplemented, I was very busy and had little time for this app, but it will change some day, because I really feel this could be a useful service.
